This code will:

- Let you create/manage users by hooking in Devise
- Let you create conversations with Ollama's locally hosted Llama3.1 LLM that are assigned to a user
- Let you save and retrieve these conversations so that they can be continued at any time.

As I have tried to keep this on target I am not doing any error checking, nor am I doing the stuff we donâ€™t specifically need for this (logging out, creating users via UI, etc etc). I leave that as an exercise to the reader!
